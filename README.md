# Build process
Day 1: I made the driver and car models.
Day 2 : I deleted the models and remade them but with relationships.
Day 3 : I succefully rendered some of the pages in Rails and tested.I implimented the CRU in CRUD for the driver model.
Day 4 : I made completed the CRUD for the driver model and added some CRUD for the car model. Then I encoutnterd some bugs while trying to delete some of the items, I discovered the problems were in the car controller and I fixed the problem. 
Day 5 : I attempted the authentication but ultimately failed.
Day 6 : I rewatched some videos and implemented the authentication and made the page force the authentication. And made some accounts. Then I cleaned up the pages by adding some navigation.
Day 7 : Only CSS.
Day 8 : Mostly CSS and I started the README.
Day 9 : I finished the CSS and README and made the Code more DRY.

Challenges

# Wins
I got the authentication working and full CRUD working on the Driver model. And I got the pages working well and looking good.

# Bugs
Sometimes when deleting the app will not delete the driver. And sometimes the app only displays the drivers first name.

# Improvement
The CSS could be so much better and I could have added more content to the app. As well asaddede full CRUD to the cras as well.
