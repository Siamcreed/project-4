# Build process
Challenges

# Wins
I got the authentication working and full CRUD working on the Driver model

# Bugs
Sometimes when deleting the app will not delete the driver. And sometimes the app only displays the drivers first name.

# Improvement
The CSS could be so much better and I could have added more content to the app. As well asaddede full CRUD to the cras as well.
